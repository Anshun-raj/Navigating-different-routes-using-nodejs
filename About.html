        <p>A prime minister or a premier is the head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. Under those systems, a prime minister is not the head of state
            or a monarch, but rather the head of government, serving typically under a monarch in a democratic constitutional monarchy or under a president in a republican form of government.

            In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or their official representative (e.g., monarch, president,
            governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers.

            In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems,
            notably in semi-presidential systems, a prime minister is the official appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state.
